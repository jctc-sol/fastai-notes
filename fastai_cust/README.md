This directory holds python codes that are attempt at reconstructing parts of the original FastAI framework as taught by Jeremy Howard in his version3-part2 of FastAI MOOC.

The following are directly copied from the original FastAI repository as foundations to build on:
- imports/*
- datatsets.py
- core.py
